The goal of vascr is to easily process impedance sensing data from ECIS, xCELLigence, cellZscope and ScioSpec platforms.

## Installation

You can install the development version of vascr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("JamesHucklesby/vascr")
```

## Example

Vascr can rapidly plot impedance sensing data.

```{r example}
library(vascr)
vascr_plot_line(growth.df %>% vascr_subset(unit = "R", frequency = "4000"))
```
