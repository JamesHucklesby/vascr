## Resubmission
This is a re submission. In this version I have:

* Proofread the DESCRIPTION, thank you for catching this error

* Reduced the number of spaces in the description, somehow indents as spaces became baked into the previous version

* Examples removed from vascr_find_level RD file

* Commented out examples made active or removed

* Dontrun replaced with donttest

* Shiny packages wrapped in if(interactive())
